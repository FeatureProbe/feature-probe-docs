# Project and Environment

## Project Management
Projects allow one FeatureProbe account to manage multiple different business goals. Generally a project corresponds to a system platform. For example, you can create a project called "Mobile Application" and another project called "Server Application". Each project has its own unique environment and corresponding functional toggles. You can create multiple environments in each project, all projects must have at least one environment
The system will have an initial project (My First Project) with 2 environments (test, online) each with its own SDK key to connect the FeatureProbe SDK to the specific environment.
